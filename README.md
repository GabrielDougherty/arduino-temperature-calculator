# Arduino temperature converter project

This is an arduino project to convert Fahrenheit temperatures (entered on a keypad) to Celsius. The converted temperature is displayed as soon as the second digit of the temperature is entered. To convert a single digit temperature, hit the # or * key after the single digit number.

# Why

Mainly because I wanted to learn Arduino programming. But also because at my job, I work with folks outside of the US who want to know what the weather has been like recently. I wanted a quick way to convert a temperature in my head (like I know it has been 88F recently) into a Celsius temperature.
